(6) What is Request-Response Communication ?
=> Request-Response communication is a type of communication in which one device or system sends a request 
for data or action to another device or system, and the latter responds with the requested data or action. 
In this type of communication, the requesting device or system is called the client, while the responding 
or system is called the server.

(7) What is Publish-subscribe Communication ?
=> Publish-Subscribe communication is a type of communication in which publishers 
send messages to a message broker, and subscribers receive those messages from the 
message broker. It allows for decoupling of the sender and receiver, and allows for
flexible and scalable communication.

(8) What is pull-push communication ? 
=> Push-pull communication is a type of communication in which one system or device actively sends data 
to another system or device (push), while the other system or device periodically requests data from 
first system (pull). This communication model is often used in data synchronization and real-time updates.

(9) What is exclusive-pair communication ?
=> Exclusive-pair communication model is a type of communication in which two devices or systems are connected
directly and communicate exclusively with each other. This communication model is often used in peer-to-peer 
networking and requires a dedicated connection between the two devices or systems.

(10) Define TCP & UDP.
=> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are 
both communication protocols used for transmitting data over networks.

	(1) TCP : TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable, connection-oriented 
			 communication protocol used for transmitting data over networks.
	
	(2) UDP : UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a fast, connectionless communication protocol 
			 used for transmitting data over networks with minimal overhead and no error checking.
